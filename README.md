# Personal Portfolio Website

Hey there! This is my personal portfolio where I showcase who I am, what I can do, and some of the cool projects I’ve worked on. I built this with **React** to give visitors—whether employers or collaborators—a clear idea of my skills and experience.

## Why This Portfolio?

I wanted a space where I could put all my work, skills, and achievements in one place. It’s kind of like a digital resume, but a bit more interactive and fun. Plus, it makes it easier for people to get to know me beyond just a piece of paper.
