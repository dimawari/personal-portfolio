          I‚Äôm Evangeline B. Anggana, but most people call me Eva‚Äîa 20-year-old Information Systems student from Bulacan.
          My journey, much like navigating ‚Äúhard times,‚Äù has been about turning challenges into growth.
          I value both independent problem-solving and collaborative teamwork, always with an eye for accuracy, efficiency, and user-centered results.

            Currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (Year III),
            I‚Äôve been fortunate to earn recognition as a Dean‚Äôs Lister and previously graduated Senior High School with honors, Best in Capstone,
            and a DOST-recommended project under the STEM strand.

    Outside academics, I explore creativity through historical fiction, poetry, and storytelling,
    balancing it with practical hobbies like cooking and book collecting. Even the small things‚Äîlike reading random facts at 2 AM‚Äîfeed my curiosity and broaden my perspective.

            My long-term passion is Quality Assurance, where I see myself combining attention to detail with the drive to ensure excellence in systems and processes.
            At the same time, storytelling remains at the heart of how I understand both people and projects.

          <p>
            Last school year, I was asked by a classmate to test a web application they developed for a course project.
            My role was to act as a user tester and provide detailed feedback on bugs, usability issues, and overall experience.
            All of my observations and suggestions were documented in their project‚Äôs QA spreadsheet.
            While this isn‚Äôt an official project of mine, it reflects my approach to testing, attention to detail, and communication as an SQA.

            And as someone who's not a fan of coding and programming, it was hard to code all by yourself, especially being in a role of something you're really unfamiliar with.

          <p>
            SQA is not just about finding bugs or pointing out mistakes and lapses, but about ensuring that the team delivers a high-quality product.
            As someone who gets bothered by small mistakes, I later realized that the role of SQA fits me perfectly.
